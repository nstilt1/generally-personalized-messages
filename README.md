# generally-personalized-messages
If you want to have personalized messages without knowing anything about a user, this is a solution

Most of the text was written by ChatGPT. The text is meant to have minimal traces of negativity in it.

# Categories
I will not publicly disclose how these messages are categorized. Just understand that they serve a purpose similar to affirmations. Here is a general idea behind it:

Cat1 is generalized messages that don't really address any specific negative emotions.
Cat2 and Cat3 indirectly address some negative emotions that most people experience regularly.

I probably wouldn't spam messages that are only from Cat2 and Cat3. I would probably reserve *at least* 40% of all messages to be from Cat1.

# To-Do
* Copy over data (working on revising the outputs)
