# Categories
The messages are grouped by the types of mental health issues they are supposed to address. It doesn't matter if there is any overlap/intersection with the message categories.

Cat1 is for non-negative messages that don't address any issues.

I probably wouldn't spam messages that are only from Cat2 and Cat3. I would probably reserve *at least* 40% of all messages to be from Cat1.

# To-Do
